## Focus and Commit to Priorities

- Successful organizations focus on the handful of initiatives that can make a real difference, deferring less urgent ones
- “must be able to measure… performance and results against the goal.” Peter Drucker
- If you’re certain you’re going to nail it, you’re probably not pushing hard enough
- The best OKR cadence is the one that fits the context and culture of your business
- Completion of all key results must result in attainment of the objective. If not, it’s not an OKR
- The one thing an OKR system should provide par excellence is focus. This can only happen if we keep the number of objectives small

## Align and Connect for Teamwork

- Public goals are more likely to be attained than goals held in private
- Meritocracy flourishes in sunlight
- Companies with highly aligned employees are more than twice as likely to be top performers
- People who choose their destination will own a deeper awareness of what it takes to get there
- MyFitnessPal and Under Armor: “North star alignment”: “When our customers succeed at reaching their health and fitness goals, we succeed as a company”.

## Track for Accountability

- OKRs are living, breathing organisms
- The single greatest motivator is ‘making progress in one’s work.’ The days that people make progress are the days they feel most motivated and engaged
- The point of a real-time dashboard is to quantify progress against a target and flag what needs attention
- Where OKRs scores pinpoint what went right or wrong in the work, and how the team might improve, self-assessments drive a superior goal-setting process for the next quarter
- There are no judgments, only learning
- The Gates Foundation: making goals concrete

## Stretch for Amazing

- “The biggest risk of all is not taking one” – Mellody Hobson
- BHAG: “Big Hairy Audacious Goals” – Jim Collins
- Google divides its OKRs into two categories, committed goals and aspirational (or “stretch”) goals
- There is no one magic number for the “right” stretch. If you seek to achieve greatness, stretching for amazing is a great place to start
- Google: “The Gospel of 10x”. Gmail: 1 GB of storage when web-based email systems offered 2 to 4 MB

# Continuous Performance Management: OKRs and CFRs

**CFRs**. **C**onversations, **F**eedback, **R**ecognition

## Conversations

An authentic, richly textured exchange between manager and contributor, aimed at driving performance

## Feedback

Bidirectional or networked communication among peers to evaluate progress and guide future improvement

## Recognition

Expressions of appreciation to deserving individuals for contributions of all sizes

# Culture

- **Structure and clarity**: are goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?
- **Psychological safety**: can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?
- **Meaning of work**: are we working on something that is personally important for each of us?
- **Dependability**: can we count on each other to do high-quality work on time?
- **Impact of work**: do we fundamentally believe that the work we’re doing matters?
