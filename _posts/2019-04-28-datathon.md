From April 25-27th 2019 Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein (HIAE), the PROADI-SUS project and MIT organized its Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare Symposium and Datathon.

In the first day, we attended a Symposium including talks and round tables with experts in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Healthcare. I took some notes of things I found interesting and will be posting here for further consultation.

# Symposium

### Richard Delaney - Vital Strategies
_Intersection Between High-dimensionality Data and Established Public Health Databases_	
- High Dimensional Data:
    - Many factors to control for, harder to do hypothesis testing. One alternative is to leverage machine learning to do more pattern recognition
    - Don't always come with pre conceived ideas, but try to find patterns freely
    - Find probabilities of actions to know where to deliver Public health service
- Creating conditions to success:
    1. Start with a project: avoid "We prepare and then we act", we are never prepared enough!
    Start easy, purposeful, datathon events follow this idea!
    2. After the first step, discuss systemic changes

### Nick Guldemond - The Institute of Health Policy & Management Erasmus University
_Digital Technologies for Public and Private Primary Care_	
- Design Thinking for Health Data Science Projects
    - Patient Journey
    - Clinical Pathway
- Data new vs old [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data)
    - **F**indable
    - **A**ccessible
    - **I**nteroperable
    - **R**eusable
- If we find a good solution, how do we scale? To another region, etc...

### Jacson Venâncio Barros - President of the Brazilian Association of CIO’s in Health
_Technologies for Supporting Public Health Management and Governance_
Problem: Startups are disconnected from end users
- 70% of hospitals don't have eletronic medical records
- Lack of standards in vocabulary (taxonomy)
- Asymmetry of information: each specialty has its own jargon
- Lack of trust among health sectors
**Challenge**: Identify in this sea of ​​data, which is the drop that interests us

### Round Table: Challenges of Big Data and AI in Population Health	- Gisele Bohn, Richard Delaney, Nick Guldemond, Jacson Barros, Fatima Marinho

Topics:
- Aggregate behavioral data to clinical data
- Think small first: break problems into small questions that big data can help
- Predict events that are repeated in certain population groups
- Integration with the real world
- How social networks influence behaviour

### Open Session: Data Access, Privacy and Security - Andrea Suman, Silvio Pereira, Anderson Soares, Marcelo Felix, Rogéria Leoni Cruz

- Restrictive law?
- Big Data x Data Governance
- No safe culture, territoriality, data sharing (would it restrict the access for research?)
- Loss of potential of using machine learning

### Leonardo Rolim Ferraz
Data Driven ICU - Einstein Initiative

### Lucas Bulgarelli - MIT/HIAE
Big Data 360
- MIMIC
- De-identification
- Leveraging electronic health records for clinical research
- Sharing - Physionet

### Ary Serpa Neto - HIAE
Innovative Models of Clinical Trials Using Large Databases	

### Christopher Cosgriff - MIT
Deep Learning: A Brief Overview for Clinicians

### Round Table: Challenges of Big Data and AI in the Intensive Care Unit - Leo Anthony Celi, Alistair Johnson, Leonardo Rolim Ferraz, Ary Serpa Neto, Lucas Bulgarelli
- The Book of Why

### Leo Anthony Celi - MIT
MIT Experience in Data Analytics applied to Intensive Care Units
- MIMIC (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care)
- Book: Secondary Analysis of Electronic Health Records
- Opportunities for AI in Healthcare
    - Classification
    - Prediction
    - Optmization (Precision Medicine)

### Alistair Johnson - MIT
Keynote: MIMIC Across Modalities: X-rays and Beyond
- Chest X-rays are ubiquitous, radiologists are not
- Perfect algorithms on imperfect reports

### Matthieu Komorowski - Imperial College London
Keynote: Reinforcement Learning Approaches to Decision Support in Sepsis

### Open Session: Opportunities for Innovation in Healthcare - Pedro Marton Pereira, Gustavo Landsberg, Gisele Bohn, André Bem
I forgot to take notes.

**Pulse Pressure: a new outcome predictor in the Intensive Care Unit?**

## Brief literature review and motivation for study
- Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) is the main parameter used to define hemodynamic condition in critically ill patients and levels below 65mmHg are related to poor outcomes especially in septic patients
- Pulse Pressure (PP) is related to pressure and stroke volume.
- Pulse Pressure is a neglected hemodynamic parameter at bedside.

## Aim of Study
Evaluate if Pulse Pressure is a reliable predictor of 28-days mortality compared to Mean Arterial Pressure in critically ill patients

## Data Source
- Inclusion criteria:
    - First ICU admissions (MIMIC-3)

- Exclusion criteria
    - Patients readmitted at ICU in the same hospitalization
    - Age < 18 years

## Statistical analysis
1. Description of the sample: 
    - mean and standard deviation
    - bars plots and boxplots
 
2. Logistic regression model
    - Outcome: 28-days mortality (from ICU admission)
    - Model 1: mean arterial pressure
    - Model 2: pulse pressure

## Results
### Characteristis of the Sample

SD: standard deviation
*Values taken when the minimum systolic blood pressure where observed in the first 24h of ICU admission 

### MAP vs PP

### Logistic Regression
Outcome = 28-days mortality

Model 1: predictor = mean arterial pressure 
OR = **0.9694**
95% IC = 0.9672 - 0.9717

Model 2: predictor = pulse pressure 
OR = **0.9960**
95% IC = 0.9942 - 0.9977

### Discussion and Next Steps
- MAP assessment alone might not be useful to predict outcome to all ICU patients
- Preliminary result: PP assessment looks to be a better outcome predictor for “higher PP” patients
- Promising results: min PP>70 - No min MAP difference between outcomes

Next Steps:
- Group analysis: who are those patients? Are they elderly people?
- Check ICU interventions (mechanical ventilation, vasopressors etc)?
- Should we develop a specific guideline for those patients?
