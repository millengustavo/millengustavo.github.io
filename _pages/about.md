I'm a Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Neuroscience researcher. Areas of expertise are concentrated in Classification Algorithms and EEG Signal Analysis.

I'm also interested in Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies and Artificial Intelligence.

My main goal is to figure out how to connect these technologies, with the best in each of them, to leverage disruptive ideas.
